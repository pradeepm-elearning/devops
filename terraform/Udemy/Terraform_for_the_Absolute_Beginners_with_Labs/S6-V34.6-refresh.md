main.tf

If there are any changes made to a resource created by Terraform outside its control, such as a manual update, "terraform refresh" Command will pick it up and update the state file. This reconciliation is useful to determine what action to take during the next apply. This command will not modify any infrastructure resource, but it will modify the state file.
