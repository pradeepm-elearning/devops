SECTION-12   : KUBERNATES IN ACTION - DIVING INTO THE CORE CONCEPTS
VIDEO-190    : EXPOSING A DEPLOYMENT WITH A SERVICE

Services
	Exposes Pod created by a deployment by creating service.

Create a Service Object to the Cluster	
	kubectl expose deployment DEP_NAME --type=TYPES_OF_SERVICES --port=PORTNUMBER
	kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

Types of Services
	ClusterIP    - This is a default Services which means it will only be reachable inside the Cluster. The Address doesnt change.
	NodePort     - This deployment should be exposed with help of the IP Address of a worker node on which it is running. This can be accessible by outside.
	LoadBalancer - Utilizes a Load Balancer which has to exist in the infrastructure on which our cluster runs.
				   Load Balancer will generate a Unique Address for this service.
				   It will also evenly distribute incoming traffic across all Pods which are part of this services.
				   It will only run if the infrastructure of the Cluster supports it. Like AWS Load Balancer, minikube etc.

View number of Services created
	kubectl get services
	
Since we do not get an EXTERNAL-IP from the above command output, we need to take help from the Minikube.
Minikube give us access to the Services mapping a special port to an IP which we can reach from local machine & which identifies the Virtual Machine running on Local Machine.
	minikube service DEP_NAME
	minikube service first-app
