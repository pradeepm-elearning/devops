SECTION-12   : KUBERNATES IN ACTION - DIVING INTO THE CORE CONCEPTS
VIDEO-189    : THE SERVICE OBJECT (RESOURCE)

Dis-advantage of Internal IP in a Pods
	1. We cannot use them to access the Pods from outside the Cluster.
	2. It changes when the Pods are replaced during Scalling.

Service Object
	It is an object responsible for exposing Pods to another Pods in the cluster or externally.
	It groups Pods together and gives them a shared IP address. This address wont change.
	It can allow external access to Pods.
	
Without Services, Pods are very hard to reach and communication is difficult.
Reaching a Pod from Outside the Cluster is not possible at all without Services.
