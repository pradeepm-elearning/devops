VIDEO-194    : DEPLOYMENT ROLLBACKS & HISTORY

If you try to update with a tag which doesnt exist in the Docker Hub, it will still try to update and it will fail.

To check the progress of the Rollouts
	kubectl rollout status deployment/DEP_NAME
	kubectl rollout status deployment/first-app
	
In such case, the old Pods doesn't get shutdown/terminate. However, the new instance will not start and will be in state of ERROR.
The new update will never finish because the new Pod will never start due to the unknown Docker Tag. Which means we need to rollback the update.

To Rollback the latest deployment
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/DEP_NAME
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app

To View the number of Rollback History
	kubectl rollout history deployment/DEP_NAME --revision=NUMBER
	kubectl rollout history deployment/first-app --revision=3

To Rollback to even older deployment with history.
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/DEP_NAME --to-revision=NUMBER
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/first-app --to-revision=1
