Understanding "State"

State: State is a data created and used by your application which must not be lost.

There are two types of State
1. User-generated data, user accounts, ...
	-	often stored in the database, but could also be files (e.g., uploads)
2. Intermediate results derived by the application.
	-	often stored in memory, temporary database tables or files.

These 2 datas are important. Hence we need to persist data during a container restart.
This is the reason we need Volumes.

While using kubernates, we wont be able to add the volumes using Docker commands.
We need to configure Kubernates to add Volumes to the Containers.
